    "text": "Hi, my name is Alayna Daws. As a Customer Insights Analyst in the SaaS space, I have had the privilege of working in a fast-paced, collaborative environment where insights I uncover drive impactful decisions. I’m passionate about transforming messy data into clear, actionable insights that empower cross-functional teams to optimize their strategies and performance. I am a Summa Cum Laude graduate from the University of Georgia, holding both a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics. I am a third-generation UGA graduate and believe my blood truly runs red and black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy path to statistics has been a little unconventional. I began college pursuing an education in microbiology with the goal to become a virologist. During my first semester at UGA, I took a biostatistics course. This course introduced me to a profession that combined my love for science, love for math, and desire to help others. My first biostatistics professor encouraged me to add a statistics minor, so I added a minor in statistics that evening. Since then, my statistics minor evolved into a major, and I further advanced my studies by earning a graduate degree in Statistics. Statistics has empowered me to better contribute to research in every stage of the scientific process from experimental design to exploratory data analysis. I love that statistics grants me the ability to “play in everyone’s backyard” (John Tukey)!\n\n\n\nI’ve always thrived in environments where teamwork and collaboration are key. As a Customer Insights Data Analyst, I’ve had the chance to work in a small team where each person’s contributions really matter. My role involves cleaning and maintaining complex datasets, ensuring data integrity, and delivering insights that help marketing, sales, customer experience, and customers make more informed decisions.\nI love turning data into stories, whether through automated reports, interactive dashboards, or presentations. I’ve worked across departments, transforming complex data into visuals and insights that speak to different audiences. From identifying trends to designing predictive models and streamlining reporting processes with Python, I find creative ways to make data actionable for various stakeholders.\nI help stakeholders understand the “so what” behind the numbers, enabling data-driven decision-making and optimizing business strategies. My passion is using data to inform the bigger picture and drive meaningful actions.\n\n\nI have extensive experience working with R Markdown and R tidyverse, Python, SQL, Git, Qualtrics, and Microsoft Office. These tools allow me to clean, analyze, and visualize data in ways that are both meaningful and actionable for stakeholders across the business. I have utilized HEX for dashboarding, enabling teams to access real-time insights more efficiently.\n\n\n\nFor my MS degree, I completed a thesis focused on quantifying spatiotemporal relationships among hurricane impacts, social vulnerability, and community resilience, using COVID-19 deaths per capita as a variable. This work gave me experience in statistical modeling and the power of data in addressing real-world challenges.\nDuring my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant for the statistics capstone course, guiding 22 senior students across 7 research projects. This experience opened my eyes to the joy of supporting diverse projects and collaborating with others to solve complex problems. Over the course of my studies, I assisted with five courses, including Statistical Capstone Course I & II, Applied Regression Analysis, and Statistical Methods.\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, my goal is to continue using data to help people and organizations make informed, impactful decisions. I’m excited by the opportunity to work alongside talented teams, uncovering insights that empower others and turning complex data into clear, actionable stories.\nI’m passionate about advancing my technical skills and working with larger datasets to uncover deeper insights. By improving processes through automation and creating intuitive visualizations, I aim to make data more accessible and impactful for those who need it most.\n\n\n\nMy most cherished time is time spent with my family. My younger brother is attending UGA, and I enjoy visiting him in Athens. My guilty pleasure is watching ’80s rom-coms.\n\n\n\nIn the Summer of 2019, I attended a camp in West Virginia called the National Youth Science Camp (NYSC). While at NYSC, I met two people from every state in the United States as well as people from 10 different countries across the Americas! NYSC was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. We had no cell service or internet access during the four-week camp. This really gave me an opportunity to connect with other people my age who were just as passionate about science. I also did lots of outdoor activities I never thought I would try, including a 20-mile mountain biking trip.\n\n\n\nMe and my NYSC best friend, Kristen"

I was drawn to the Firefly Partners, LLC project because the digital marketing agency is women-owned and delivers solutions that help progressive nonprofits achieve goals. The partnership was facilitated through Riipen, a service that connects companies that need help solving problems relevant to their business model with suitable university courses. The purpose of the survey was to gather qualitative and quantitative data to tell the story of Firefly’s work and how effective their partnerships have been in creating positive change. After the conclusion of the survey, the data was analyzed using R and the findings were presented to representatives at Firefly Partners, LLC. This helped Firefly Partners, LLC tailor their experience to better accommodate current and future users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download Presentation"

    "text": "Abstract: This study aims to quantify spatiotemporal relationships among hurricane impacts, social vulnerability, and community resilience with COVID-19 deaths per capita. Data used in this study included the Southeastern US with Hospital Service Areas (HSAs) and Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) instead of county-level data. The Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) modeling method was employed to index and filter spatial autocorrelation (SA) from the residuals. SA was visualized to understand better the spatial structure meaningful covariates contain. The MESF model outperformed the linear model, not accounting for SA. Adjusted R-squared was 49.8% higher, and residual SE decreased 29.3% when comparing a 4-nearest-neighbor HRR to the linear model not considering SA. Analyzing cumulative COVID-19 deaths with this methodology is more effective at the HRR than at the HSA level. Additionally, vulnerability and resilience indicators were more substantial than hurricane impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image captures the 12 Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) models fit.\nI have included the introduction, results and conclusion sections of the thesis below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download Thesis"

In Zimbabwe, farmers’ crops have been trampled and eaten, tourists have been negatively impacted, and local communities have faced destruction as a result of the bull elephants. The purpose of the project was to determine which repellent was most effective at keeping bull elephants away from specific areas in the region. The end goal was to create a solution that was low cost, low maintenance, with minimal negative impact to elephant health, and to quantify animal behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download Report"

This year, I focused on driving key technical improvements—like process automation, ensuring data fidelity, and leading feedback efforts with our vendor. By streamlining production and juggling multiple timelines, I was able to boost both scalability and quality. The report draws from real-time data across thousands of communities in primary, secondary, and tertiary markets, covering all 50 states, with insights from millions of prospects and customers using WelcomeHome’s CRM.\nWe expanded our analysis, integrated more feedback, and revamped marketing content to better tell the story behind the data. I also led webinars to share key takeaways and best practices, helping senior living leaders make informed decisions. This content played a crucial role in the prospect journey, aligning with Sales to convert prospects into customers.\nCollaboration was essential this year. Working closely with Marketing, Sales, and CX, I helped solve technical challenges and strengthen feedback loops, delivering actionable insights to help the senior living industry thrive in 2025.\nI’ve included a PDF of a few pages from the full report below, or you can download the complete 2024 Year in Review report here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download Report"
