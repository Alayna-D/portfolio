Data used in this study included the Southeastern US with Hospital Service Areas (HSAs) and Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) instead of county-level data. The Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) modeling method was employed to index and filter spatial autocorrelation (SA) from the residuals. SA was visualized to understand better the spatial structure meaningful covariates contain. The MESF model outperformed the linear model, not accounting for SA. Adjusted R-squared was 49.8% higher, and residual SE decreased 29.3% when comparing a 4-nearest-neighbor HRR to the linear model not considering SA. Analyzing cumulative COVID-19 deaths with this methodology is more effective at the HRR than at the HSA level. Additionally, vulnerability and resilience indicators were more substantial than hurricane impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image captures the 12 Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) models fit.\nI have included the introduction, results and conclusion sections of the thesis below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download Thesis"

    "text": "Hi, my name is Alayna Daws. In August 2023, I completed a Master of Science degree in Statistics from the University of Georgia (UGA). I completed my undergraduate degree in statistics at UGA in May 2022. I am a third-generation UGA graduate and believe my blood truly runs red and black. I am currently seeking employment and am most looking forward to gaining additional experience in the real-world with messy data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy path to statistics has been a little unconventional. I began college pursuing an education in microbiology with the goal to become a virologist. During my first semester at UGA, I took a biostatistics course. This course introduced me to a profession that combined my love for science, love for math, and desire to help others. My first biostatistics professor encouraged me to add a statistics minor, so I added a minor in statistics that evening. Since then, my statistics minor has evolved into a statistics major. Statistics has empowered me to better contribute to research in every stage of the scientific process from experimental design to exploratory data analysis. I love that statistics grants me the ability to “play in everyone’s backyard” (John Tukey)!\n\n\n\n\nDuring my graduate studies, I was a teaching assistant for the statistics capstone course all senior undergraduate statistics students take. I consulted 22 students across 7 research projects. This opportunity really opened my eyes to the joy of supporting many different projects. In total, I was a teaching assistant for 5 different courses: Statistical Capstone Course I and II, Applied Regression Analysis, Statistical Methods, and Introduction to Statistical Methods I.\nFor my MS degree, I completed a thesis where my goal was to quantify spatiotemporal relationships among hurricane impacts, social vulnerability, and community resilience with COVID-19 deaths per capita.\nMy coding experience is predominantly in R. I have experience working in R Markdown and R tidyverse, Python, GitHub, and Microsoft Office.\nDuring my statistics capstone class as an undergraduate, I collaborated with two other capstone students to design an experiment and completed exploratory data analysis around bull elephants in Zimbabwe.\nAs a part of another course alongside two other Statistics students, I aided in a survey designed on behalf of Firefly Partners, LLC. Firefly Partners, LLC project is women-owned and delivers solutions that help progressive nonprofits achieve goals. This partnership was facilitated through Riipen.\nI have leadership and time management experience through my roles as a Resident Assistant and as the Vice Chair of Assignments of the Arch Society.\n\n\n\n\nI am currently seeking employment where I intend to gain industry experience in a career that utilizes and enhances my knowledge and analysis skills. I hope to have a career that revolves around helping others. In the future, I would like to support ending gaps in immunization coverage. My personal purpose is to aid in the development of affordable and effective vaccines to help people live a higher quality of life by preventing the spread of common diseases.\n\n\n\nMy most cherished time is time spent with my family. My younger brother recently started at UGA and I could not be more excited. My guilty pleasure is watching ’80s rom-coms. I also enjoy spending time with my dog, Roxy.\n\n\n\nIn the Summer of 2019, I attended a camp in West Virginia called the National Youth Science Camp (NYSC). While at NYSC, I met two people from every state in the United States as well as people from 10 different countries across the Americas! NYSC was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. We had no cell service or internet access during the four-week camp. This really gave me an opportunity to connect with other people my age who were just as passionate about science. I also did lots of outdoor activities I never thought I would try, including a 20-mile mountain biking trip. \n\n\n\nBuilding a Phylogeny with R\nI have attached a link to a tutorial of gathering sequence data, reading the sequence data into R, and creating phylogenetic trees. There are multiple approaches to complete this. The video uses a slighlty different approach I have used in the past. Last Spring, I completed a project using COVID-19 sequence data to create and analyze phylogenetic trees. The R package “phangorn” was used to fit phylogenetic trees from aligned sequence data. The sequence data was imported using the “read.phydat” command as a FASTA file. A distance matrix was calculated using the “dist.ml” function. Distance-based methods result in a transformation of the sequence data into pairwise distances. I really enjoyed this project and wanted to share some information about Phylogeny in R."
